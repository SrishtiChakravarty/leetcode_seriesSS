Given a value V, if we want to make a change for V cents, and we have an infinite supply of each of C = { C1, C2, .., Cm} valued coins, what is the minimum number of coins to make the change? If itâ€™s not possible to make a change, print -1.

Examples:  

Input: coins[] = {25, 10, 5}, V = 30
Output: Minimum 2 coins required We can use one coin of 25 cents and one of 5 cents 

Input: coins[] = {9, 6, 5, 1}, V = 11
Output: Minimum 2 coins required We can use one coin of 6 cents and 1 coin of 5 cents






#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
int findMinimumCoins(int amount) 
{
     int arr[9]={1,2,5,10,20,50,100,500,1000};
    int c=0,i=8;
    while(amount!=0){
        if(arr[i]>amount)i--;
        else if(amount==arr[i])
            return c+1;
        else if(amount>arr[i]){
            amount=amount-arr[i];
            c++;
        }
    }
    return c;
}
